          (Ref) The git ref of openvox-agent to run the Beaker test
          suite from.

          If testing something from openvox8, this should be a ref off
          of main.

          If testing something from openvox7, this should be a ref off
          of the 7.x branch.

          (Pre-release Build) Whether to test unreleased version
          packages from the artifacts server, or released packages
          from the given collection.

          If this is true, version must be a valid version, not
          latest, and collection is ignored. The workflow will
          download and install the matching openvox-agent package file
          from the artifacts-url server.

          If this is false, version and collection must match, and the
          workflow will install the given openvox collection package
          and then let the system package manager install the latest
          or version package from the collection repository.
